Welcome to Tyler's Goodreads Analysis App. This app scrapes (and never keeps or stores!) the books you've read and analyzes data about your book list, including estimating the gender breakdown of the authors, and looking at the distribution of the age and length of book you read. After some nice graphs, it tries to recommend a curated book list to you from a famous public reader, like Barack Obama or Bill Gates. One last tip, if you're on a mobile device, switch over to landscape for viewing ease. Give it a go!")
